# Prerequisite field theory knowledge

This course follows a first semester course of quantum field theory which covers the following topics. This corresponds roughly to the first 6 chapters of Peskin and Schroeder, with some of the concepts in Chapter 7.

- Canonical quantization of free scalar fields
  * energy and momentum of single particle states
  * [\phi(x), \phi(y)] and causality
  * time-ordered two-point correlator and the propagator
- Interacting scalar fields, illustrated by phi-4
  * time-ordered correlation functions
  * Dyson series
  * Wick's theorem
  * space-time and momentum-space Feynman diagrams
- Free 'classical' Dirac field
  * 'representations of the Lorentz group' motivation for fermion fields and the Clifford algebra ( c.f. chapter 3 of P&S )
  * 'traditional' motivation of the Dirac equation (done in homework)
  * Weyl and Dirac basis Gamma matrices
  * explicit solutions of the Dirac equation in Dirac basis (i.e. u's and v's)
- Quantizing the Dirac field
  * anticommutation of fields
  * conserved charge, particles and antiparticles
  * sketch of angular momentum to justify J=1/2
  * fermion propagator
  * parity and charge conjugation in homework
- Scattering and the S-matrix
  * relation of d\sigma and \mathcal{M}
  * \mathcal{M} as sum of connected/amputated diagrams [ motivated by not rigorously proved ... LSZ only sketched, cluster decomposition explained in words only ]
  * illustration in phi-4, momentum-space Feynman rules
  * interacting fermions and the 'extra' -1's from anticommutation
  * Yukawa theory of interacting fermions and scalars, tree-level diagrams
- QED at tree level
  * Feynman rules presented without proof, only some reasonable motivation - gauge symmetry not discussed
  * e+ e- -> mu+ mu-, spin-averaging, trace tools, evaluation in the cm-frame, helicity dependence of amplitude
  * e- mu- -> e- mu- and brief discussion of crossing symmetry
  * Mandelstam variables and the Mandelstam plane
  * Compton scattering - Ward identity stated without proof
  * crossing the Compton amplitude: e- e+ -> gamma gamma
- Introduction to 'radiative corrections'
  * 1 loop vertex correction in QED
    => Feynman parameter trick
    => Wick rotation
    => 'Pauli-Villars'-style regularization $\frac{1}{p^2} \to \frac{1}{p^2 - \mu^2} - \frac{1}{p^2 -\Lambda^2}$
    => only very brief discussion of infrared divergence
    => realization of logarithmic ultraviolet divergence
  * Sketch of phi-4 at one-loop
    => sketch of dimensional regularization
    => 1 loop correlation to propagator and vertex
    => setting parameters and absorbing divergences using a renormalization condition = 'experimental' input
    => 'getting rid of the scale mu' -> RG eqn -> running coupling/mass
