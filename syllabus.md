## Class Meetings

I expect you to read and understand the material that is assigned by the time you come to class (most class meetings will have assigned material). In class I will go over the material, focusing on the conceptual steps and difficult transitions, adding hopefully interesting digressions, and skipping some of the more tedious derivations. In class I will also expect that you can begin to apply the material to simple problems.

## Required Textbooks

This course is an advanced graduate course. As such it is closer to the current status of the field of particle physics than any other traditional course you have taken before. In many cases, the material presented is new or as only been recently confirmed by experiments. Older textbooks are bound to have gaps in material, whereas newer textbooks may not yet have reached the level of pedagogical effectiveness as textbooks that have withstood the test of time (and benefited from several revisions).

For this course I have chosen one required textbook that balances the pedagogy with up to date information (prices current as of this writing):
* The Standard Model and Beyond, Second Edition. Paul Langacker, CRC Press (2017).
  * Publisher: CRC Press, (link)[https://www.crcpress.com/The-Standard-Model-and-Beyond-Second-Edition/Langacker/p/book/9781498763219] ($79.96 new hardcover or ebook)
  * Amazon: (link)[https://www.amazon.com/Standard-Beyond-Physics-Cosmology-Gravitation/dp/1498763219] ($80.15 new, $52.95 used, $31.74 rent)
  * W&M bookstore: (link)[http://www.wm.edu/bookstore], then search for ISBN 9781498763219 ($99.95 new hardcover or ebook, $74.95 used, $82.45 rent new, $47.50 rent used)

One copy of this textbook is available through the physics library. I have not requested this copy to be placed on reserve, so you can check it out. In the interest of collegiality, please do not monopolize your use of it.

## Supporting Textbooks

Several other textbooks with accessible descriptions of the Standard Model are available. I encourage you, as a class, to ensure you have access to several of these texts. If you are already associated with a research group, you may have some textbooks already available to you. Your adviser may even have a preference. Others are available through the library.

## Homework

There will be *bi-weekly short homework assignments* (basically, by every class meeting a problem will be due). The assignments are listed with their due dates in the course calendar; they are due at the beginning of class. Late submissions will not be accepted (since the class will involve a discussion of the solution). If you have to miss a class, for whatever reason, please ensure that the homework assignment is turned in by the time the class starts. Deviations from these rules require *advance* permission from the instructor. Students who are auditing the course are encouraged to submit homework assignments as well.

The goal of homework assignments is not for the instructor to assess you, but for you to learn the material. Therefore you are expected to (re)do the homework problems until you can correctly solve them and understand the solution completely. Your homework assignment grade will be based in equal parts on two components:
* your good faith effort in completing the assignment to the best of your abilities by the due date,
* your ultimate submission of a legible, complete, and correct solution.

In class I will pick one person to present their solution for discussion (at random, using an *n*-sided die). You will present your solution, go over the salient points of the derivation as needed, and respond to questions from your class mates. You will also be responsible for 'grading' the submissions of your class mates on the first criterion (good faith effort) by the beginning of the next class. You will mark the submissions with pointers where you think additional information should be provided.

Homework assignments are an exercise in scientific communication, in both form and content.
* I require homework assignment submissions that are legible. If you do not have clear handwriting, I strongly encourage homework assignments that are typeset (in LaTeX or otherwise). Considering the opportunity to revise your homework assignments, typesetting may have its benefits. Naturally, copying from others is not allowed.
* I expect clear and complete discussion. This includes sentences tying the equations together. Assignments with only equations (unless explicitly allowed) will be returned without review. Arguably, those sentences do more to convince me that you are actually understanding the material.

I strongly encourage you to *discuss* the problems with your fellow students. However, mindless copying of solutions will not be tolerated.

## Exams

There will be a take-home final exam. In contrast to the homework assignments, you are expected to solve this final exams on your own. The final exam will be due on the date an in-class final exam would be scheduled.

## Presentations

A primary reason for studying the Standard Model is to go beyond it. We do not have the time to cover the large number of Standard Model extensions in detail in class. Fortunately we can scratch the surface.

You will be expected to write a 5-page (2500 words) report and present a 20-minute white-board discussion of a Standard Model extension of your choice during the last week of the course. It must satisfy the following aspects:
* The chosen Standard Model extension cannot be a current focus of research of any faculty member in the department. This prevents you from writing about your own prospective research or from research that others may be intimately familiar with. You are of course welcome to contact others outside of the department with questions.
* The literature review report will be fully sourced with references to peer reviewed papers (not to unreviewed materials such as websites, popular descriptions, or textbooks).
* There must be a balance between discussion of the theoretical formalism and the experimental tests.
 * You must demonstrate a minimum of mathematical formalism to make the Standard Model extension comprehensible to your audience.
 * You must discuss at least two experimental tests (one completed and one future), and connect the experimental observables to the underlying formalism.

Along with the take-home midterm exam you will hand in your topic of choice, an abstract, and the list of references you will be basing your study on. Try to avoid significant overlap between topics. At this point you will be randomly assigned to a peer-reviewer from among your classmates who will be the *audience* you write for.

Three weeks before the end of the semester you will submit a full draft (i.e. 2500 words or 5 pages) of your report. Within one week of submission of this draft you will receive feedback from your peer-reviewer.

Your final report must be sent to the instructor at least one week before you are scheduled to give your presentation.

Your final report will be posted on the public webpage of the instructor and indexed by search engines.

## Grades

The total grade will be calculated from your homework grades (50%), the final exam (25%), and your report and presentation (25%).

## Auditing

Students are welcome to audit this course (i.e. participate not for credit). Since one only learns by doing, students who audit this course are strongly encouraged to hand in homework assignments as well as midterm and final take-home exams. Although you will not be graded on them, you are expected to make a good faith effort as you would for other courses. You are, however, not expected to present a Standard Model extension.
