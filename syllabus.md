## Class Meetings

I expect you to read and understand the material that is assigned by the time you come to class (not all class meetings will have assigned material). In class I will go over the material, focusing on the conceptual steps and difficult transitions, adding hopefully interesting digressions, and skipping some of the more tedious derivations. In class I will also expect that you can begin to apply the material to simple problems.

## Supporting Textbooks

This course is an advanced graduate course. As such it is closer to the current status of the field of particle physics than any other traditional course you have taken before. In many cases, the material presented is new or as only been recently confirmed by experiments. Older textbooks are bound to have gaps in material, whereas newer textbooks may not yet have reached the level of pedagogical effectiveness as textbooks that have withstood the test of time (and benefited from several revisions).

There is no required textbook for this course. However, nearly all of the material that we will cover can be found in one of the following textbooks. I encourage you, as a class, to ensure you have access to several of these texts. If you are already associated with a research group, you may have some textbooks already available to you. Your adviser may even have a preference. Others are available through the library.

## Homework

There will be weekly homework assignments during this course.  The assignments will be sent around on Wednesday evening and are due by 10 am the next Tuesday morning. Late submissions will not be accepted. Deviations from these rules require advance permission from the instructor. Students who are auditing the course are expected to submit homework assignments as well.

The goal of homework assignments is not for the instructor to assess you, but for you to learn the material. Therefore you are expected to (re)do the homework problems until you can correctly solve them and understand them. The homework assignments will be graded relatively harshly, but any loss in points can be completely recovered in subsequent revised submissions. Please turn in revised submissions along with the original submission in the instructor's mailbox within two weeks of the original due date. Revised submissions should be self-contained at the second level (i.e. if question 2 part *a* was correct, but part *b* was incorrect, your revised submission can skip part *a* but should be self-contained for all of part *b*).

Homework assignments are an exercise in scientific communication, in form and content.
* I require homework assignment submissions that are legible. If you do not have clear handwriting, I strongly encourage homework assignments that are typeset (in LaTeX or otherwise). Considering the opportunity to revise your homework assignments, typesetting may have its benefits. Naturally, copying from others is not allowed.
* I expect clear and complete discussion. This includes sentences tying the equations together. Assignments with only equations (unless explicitly allowed) will be return without review. Arguably, those sentences do more to convince me that you are actually understanding the material.

I strongly encourage you to *discuss* the problems with your fellow students. However, mindless copying of solutions will not be tolerated.

## Exams

There will be a take-home midterm and a take-home final exam. In contrast to the homework assignments, you are expected to solve these exams on your own.

You are expected to (re)do the exam problems until you can correctly solve them and understand them. Half of the lost points can be recovered in a subsequent revised submission, provided you make an appointment within one week of the original due date to explain your revisions in person.

## Presentations

A primary reason for studying the Standard Model is to go beyond it. We do not have the time to cover the large number of Standard Model extensions in detail in class. Fortunately we can scratch the surface.

You will be expected to write a 4-page literature review and present a 20-minute white-board discussion of a Standard Model extension of your choice in the last week of the course. It must satisfy the following:
* The literature review report will be fully sourced with references to peer reviewed papers.
* There must be a balance between discussion of the theoretical formalism and the experimental tests.
 * You must demonstrate a minimum of mathematical formalism to make the Standard Model extension comprehensible to your audience.
 * You must discuss at least two experimental tests (proposed or completed), and connect the experimental observables with the underlying formalism.

Along with the take-home midterm exam you are to hand in your topic of choice, a paragraph of discussion, and a few references you will be basing your study on. Try to avoid significant overlap between topics.

Your literature review must be sent to the instructor at least one week before you are scheduled to give your presentation.

## Grades

The total grade will be calculated from your homework grades (40%), the midterm exam (25%), the final exam (25%), and your report and presentation (10%).

## Auditing

Students are welcome to audit this course (i.e. participate not for credit). Since one only learns by doing, students who audit this course are expected to hand in homework assignments as well as midterm and final take-home exams. Although you will not be graded on them, you are expected to make a good faith effort as you would for other courses. You are, however, not expected to present a Standard Model extension.
